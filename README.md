# Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the Top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I first filtered out the duplicated rows and found out the 3 most popular data roles. Next I filtered out the top 5 skills for these 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skill I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm interested in.

### Visualize data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(Top_3),1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, title in enumerate(Top_3):
    skills = df_skills_percent[df_skills_percent['job_title_short']==title].head(5)
    # skills.plot(kind='barh', ax=ax[i], x='job_skills', y='percent', title=title)
    sns.barplot(data=skills, ax=ax[i], x='percent', y='job_skills', hue='percent', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    ax[i].set_title(title)
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 80)
    # ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_ylabel("")
    ax[i].set_xlabel("")
    if i != len(Top_3)-1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    for n,v in enumerate(skills['percent']):
        ax[i].text(v+1,n,f'{v:.0f}%',va='center')

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
```

### Results

![Visualization of Top Skills](Project\Images\SkillDemand.png)

### Insights
- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (69%) and Data Engineers (63%).
- SQL is the most requested skills for Data Analyst (50%) and Data Engineers (67%). It is also highly demanded for Data Scientist (50%).
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Spark, Azure) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be more proficient in data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).


## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysis in US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Postings')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()

ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()


```

### Results

![Trending top Skills for Data Analysts in the US](Project\Images\Skill_Trend_DA.png)

### Insights:

- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skills through the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a decrease from September to November, but it is the second most demanded skills over the year.
- Tableau and Python shows a relatively stable demand through the year with some fluctuations, but they remain the essential skills for DA. Sas while less demanded than others, shows a slightly downward trend through the year. 


## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.title('Salary Distribution in the US')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.xlim(0, 600000)
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y,_:f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

### Insights
- Thereâ€™s a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

## Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts
### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', ax=ax[0], y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', palette='dark:b_r')
ax[0].legend().remove()
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,_: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='light:b')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].legend().remove()
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary USD')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,_: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Insights
- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like mxnet, bitbucket, hugging face and dplyr are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like Python, r, sql server, and Tableau are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.
